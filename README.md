`kiali-k8s` is a charm for [Kiali](Kiali), a dashboard for [Istio](Istio).  It is a useful but non-essential tool to help someone administer their Istio service mesh.

This Charmed Operator handles deployment, scaling, configuration, and Day 2 operations specific to Kiali, and offers simple integrations to observe [Charmed Istio][Istio charm] and be observed by the [Charmed Observability Stack][COS Docs].
